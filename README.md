## Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

The intereactive dashboard displays cataloged data related to microbes that colonize in human belly buttons. The data reveals a small subset of microbial species (operational taxonomic units (OTU)) were present in more than 70% of subjects, while the rest were relatively rare. 

This assignment was completed individually with code guided by in-class examples and aided in debugging by the Xpert Learning Assistant. Data for this assignment was provided by Edx.
